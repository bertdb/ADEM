# Hardware

The project uses the SparkFun Thing. This ESP8266 based Wi-Fi controller development board runs the A.D.E.M. firmware and conveniently hosts a LiPo battery management system that is key in the mobility aspect of this project. Apart from the headers for the SparkFun Thing, the project's printed circuit board has room for a GPS module, temperature and pressure sensors and connections to external parts like the PPD40NS dust sensor.
