# ADEM
The timelab.org ADEM project enables cyclists to measure particle matters. The measurements are displayed on the device and sent via Wi-Fi to a central data collection server. This git repository hosts the hardware designs and firmware for the mobile sensor prototype.

More information is available from the project's wiki at: http://wiki.timelab.org/
