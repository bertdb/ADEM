# ADEM
The timelab.org A.D.E.M. project enables cyclists to measure dust particles. The measurements are displayed on the device and sent via Wi-Fi to a central data collection server. This git repository hosts the hardware designs and firmware for the mobile sensor prototype.

As of mid 2015, the project is in prototyping stage with the goal to have a handful of prototypes ready by the end of 2015.

## Hardware

The project uses the SparkFun Thing. This ESP8266 based Wi-Fi controller development board runs the A.D.E.M. firmware and conveniently hosts a LiPo battery management system that is key in the mobility aspect of this project. Apart from the headers for the SparkFun Thing, the project's printed circuit board has room for a GPS module, temperature and pressure sensors and connections to external parts like the PPD40NS dust sensor.

## Firmware

The firmware is written in Arduino.
